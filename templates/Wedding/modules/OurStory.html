		<h3>Kathryn says...</h3>
		<p>How we met<br/> Yes, we met online.  I checked my Inbox and got a message he “liked” me. 
		His profile had cute photos of him cycling and playing with his nephew. 
		I decided to be bold and message him rather than wait for him to message me.
		After several long e-mails, we met over lunch to eat Malaysian food. 
		He was cute in his blue shirt and he was easy to talk to.</p> 
		<p>While Raymond was flying to India, he certainly surprised me with the flowers. 
		It was very romantic and sweet.  However, I was most impressed when he cooked for me for the first time. 
		It was a very delicious pork chop dinner.</p> 
		<p>While balancing my busy school and work schedule, we were able to hang out with friends, 
		travel, hike, cycle, bowl and eat lots of yummy food.  Raymond open the doors of the bicycling world for me. 
		I learned bicycling pants were very important especially for our 50 mile Tour de Cure ride.</p>
		<p>Proposal<br/>Flash forward to Thanksgiving weekend,  Raymond had told me he setup a date night in the city.
		 I thought it was a bit strange since it wasn’t the anniversary of our first date.  
		 He claimed it was the anniversary of our first kiss.  
		 I was swamped with work and finishing my master’s project for the past few weeks.  
		 So I thought it was it was sweet of him to give me a break and a chance to dress up.  
		 Friday after Thanksgiving we had dinner by the San Francisco Ferry building. 
		 After dinner, we walked out to the pier and saw a couple who asked us to help them take a picture of them 
		 with the lit up Bay Bridge.  Since it was such a beautiful backdrop, I was going to ask them to take a photo 
		 of us.  However, Raymond said not yet, which I thought was a bit strange.  
		 Then Raymond started talking about how we met and our future.  Then silly me, I flippantly said something like 
		 “It sounds like you are going to propose to me.”  Next thing I know, he got down on one knee in front of me 
		 sand asked me to marry him. I said yes.</p>
		<p>We didn’t get a picture together by the Bridge, but he got a photo of me and the ring.</p>

		<h3>Raymond says...</h3>
		<p>
		Kathryn and I met a few weeks after mutually liking each other on OKCupid.  Our first date was lunch
		at Banana Leaf.  When she walked up to meet me for the first time, I would say my heart started beating
		faster, and no, that wasn't normal on first dates.  She wore a dress, and very pretty.  I wore a t-shirt,
		a little too casual.  Nevermind that though..  I tried to drag out that date as long as I could.
		I believe I first encountered her profile while using OKC's version of Tinder.  Lucky, I didn't accidentally swipe her to the wrong
		side.  A few days later, while in Vegas, I receive a message from her saying something to the effect of
		"Hi, apparently we like each other...".
		</p>
		<p>
		Suddenly, I was the lucky guy that met Kathryn every weekend, us gradually getting to know each other.
		The momentum was in my favor, until I took a trip to India. I was unclear whether she wanted to continue
		when I got back, so I made sure to have some flowers delivered to her while I was on a layover in Korea;
		just so she knows that I'm thinking about her.
