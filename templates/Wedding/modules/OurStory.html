		<h3>Kathryn says...</h3>
		<h5>How we met</h5>
		<p>
		Yes, we met online.  I checked my Inbox and got a message he “liked” me. 
		His profile had cute photos of him cycling and playing with his nephew. 
		I decided to be bold and message him rather than wait for him to message me.
		After several long e-mails, we met over lunch to eat Malaysian food. 
		He was cute in his blue shirt and he was easy to talk to.
		</p>
		<p>
		While Raymond was flying to India, he certainly surprised me with the flowers. 
		It was very romantic and sweet.  However, I was most impressed when he cooked for me for the first time. 
		It was a very delicious pork chop dinner.</p> 
		<p>While balancing my busy school and work schedule, we were able to hang out with friends, 
		travel, hike, cycle, bowl and eat lots of yummy food.  Raymond open the doors of the bicycling world for me. 
		I learned bicycling pants were very important especially for our 50 mile Tour de Cure ride.
		</p>
		<h5>Proposal</h5>
		<p>
		Flash forward to Thanksgiving weekend,  Raymond had told me he setup a date night in the city.
		 I thought it was a bit strange since it wasn’t the anniversary of our first date.  
		 He claimed it was the anniversary of our first kiss.  
		 I was swamped with work and finishing my master’s project for the past few weeks.  
		 So I thought it was it was sweet of him to give me a break and a chance to dress up. 
		 </p>
		 <p> 
		 Friday after Thanksgiving we had dinner by the San Francisco Ferry building. 
		 After dinner, we walked out to the pier and saw a couple who asked us to help them take a picture of them 
		 with the lit up Bay Bridge.  Since it was such a beautiful backdrop, I was going to ask them to take a photo 
		 of us.  However, Raymond said not yet, which I thought was a bit strange.
		 </p>
		 <p>
		 Then Raymond started talking about how we met and our future.  Then silly me, I flippantly said something like 
		 “It sounds like you are going to propose to me.”  Next thing I know, he got down on one knee in front of me 
		 sand asked me to marry him. I said yes.
		 </p>
		<p>
		We didn’t get a picture together by the Bridge, but he got a photo of me and the ring.

		<h3>Raymond says...</h3>
		<h5>How we met?</h5>
		<p>
		Kathryn and I met a few weeks after mutually liking each other on OKCupid.  If my memory is correct, I saw her minimized profile
		on OKC's version of the Tinder app. I was lucky to not accidentally swipe her to the wrong side.
		A few days later, I received a message from her saying something to the effect of
		"Hi, apparently we like each other...". Our first date was at Banana Leaf on a Saturday afternoon.
		When she walked up to meet me for the first time, my heart beat faster, maybe it
		skipped a beat and needed to catch up.  That wasn't normal for me on first dates.  She wore a very
		pretty dress.  Ugh! I wore a t-shirt, a little too casual. I don't think she minded though so I got away with
		one.		
		</p>
		<p>
		I was the lucky guy that Kathryn met every weekend (minus the weekend following our first date),
		us gradually getting to know each other.  The momentum was in my favor, until a trip to India paused that
		momentum.  I was unclear whether she wanted to continue when I got back, so I made sure to have some
		flowers delivered to her while I was on a layover in Korea; just so she knew I was thinking about her.
		Truth is, I didn't think of much else besides her.
		</p>
		<p>
		In the two years that followed, I'd be the guy to do maintenance on her car, cook dinners, and whatever
		I could do to try to impress my lady.  Well, she's still mine so it seems to have worked out
		</p>
		<h5>Proposal</h5>
		<p>
		In the month's leading up to the 2015 holidays, I started shopping for a diamond. Initially, I thought
		a heart shaped diamond engagement ring would be nice, but my friend Trang talked me out of it, so did Eva.
		In fact, Trang and Eva helped me quite a bit. My coworker, Hanna, also had some input.
		<p>
		<p>
		I planned to propose on Black Friday 2015. On that day, I was pretty nervous; I hadn't felt like that since the first
		few dates 2 years prior.  Before we headed out to dinner in the City for a rare date-night, the ring was in my fleece jacket pocket.
		I thought, "Oh my gosh, I think Kathryn could find this", so I told her I was going to the car to change my shoes, and used the 
		opportunity to hide the ring in the trunk of my car.  Immediately afterwards, she was ready to go. 
		When we stepped out of the apartment, I turned around to lock the door. From behind, Kathryn exclaims "I'm cold!", then
		stuck her hands in my jacket pocket.<br/><br/>
		"Whew!!", I thought to myself.  "... The ring was there just a minute ago."
		From that point, until after dinner, Kathryn still hadn't noticed the bulging ring box, which was placed back into my pocket for the upcoming question.
		</p>
		<p>
		I didn't have a proposal speech planned out, I was just winging it really.  After dinner, we walked along
		the waterfront.  I made a couple of comments about our future, and she joked that it sounded like I was going to propose to her.
		I proposed to Kathryn on Pier 7 at the Embarcadero after a nice Peruvian dinner.  She said "yes" pretty quickly.
		When she called her parents to let them know, she was surprised to find out that they already knew, and that in fact,
		they've been waiting all day wondering when she was going to call.
		</p>
		<p>
		If you're interested, I can tell you the story of how I struggled to get Kathryn's parents on the phone
		the day before (on Thanksgiving), in order to ask for their blessing.
